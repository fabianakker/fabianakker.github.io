                    <h1>Blightbound</h1>

                    <p>Blightbound is a multiplayer dungeon crawler that tasks three heroes to venture down from their mountain refuge to face the abominations of the Blight - a mysterious and corrupting fog that enshrouds the land.</p>
                    <p>I've worked for almost three years on this title, with a team of 30 developers. With this game Ronimo went back to its roots in 3D games, combining 2D characters in a 3D space. Developing a camera that had the strategic view of a hack and slash game like Diablo whilst also creating depth in the background to allow beautiful vistas was a huge challenge, but the result is pretty neat. Also getting the gameplay right between the three classes and balancing them to be evenly favorable was quite difficult, especially considering the paradigm of players chosing damage roles over support roles. I had a lot of experience balancing heroes/nauts in Awesomenauts and that came in handy for Blightbound. The game will go into early access later this year.</p>
