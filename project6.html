                    <h1>Blightbound</h1>

                    <p>Blightbound is a multiplayer dungeon crawler that tasks three heroes to venture down from their mountain refuge to face the abominations of the Blight - a mysterious and corrupting fog that enshrouds the land.</p>
                    <p>I've worked for almost three years on this title, with a team of 30 developers. The game is content heavy and very different from the projects I have done before. Getting the gameplay right between the three classes and balancing them to be evenly favorable was quite difficult but I am very happy with the end result. The game will go into early access later this year.</p>
