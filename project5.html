                    <h1>Swords & Soldiers II</h1>

                    <p>Swords & Soldiers II is the sequel to the award-winning side scrolling strategy game Swords & Soldiers by Ronimo Games. The game was released on WiiU, Steam, PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
                    <p>Working as lead designer on Swords & Soldiers 2 was interesting, because it was the first time for me to work on a sequel and also managing two projects at the same time, the other project being Awesomenauts F2P. We tried to keep the fun spirit of the first installment but also tried to innovate with mechanics such as moving bases to create a dynamic battlefield and random resource drops for creating clutch moments where the players had to push forward trying to outrun their opponent.</p>
